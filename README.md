# CSCI 6655: Web-Database Application Development - Final Project

The objective of this project was to test my knowledge in both Frontend and Backend development. In this project, I was asked to create a frontend application using Vue.js and set up a backend server using Node.js.

An abstract view of the final project:

## Deliverables
There were three major deliverable components and one optional component in this project:

### Wireframe
A wireframe was required for the front-end Vue.js application.
  
### FrontEnd
I was asked to create a front-end application using Vue.js, HTML5, CSS3 (utilizing flex or grid), and Javascript. The requirements were:  
  - The application needed to be a single-page application.  
  - The application must be developed using Vue.js.  
  - The application should be broken down into at least more than two components (excluding the root component).  
  - The application must have data passing from one component to its child component.  
  - The data must be coming from your Node Server deployed using Netlify (or any other platform you would like to host your Node server, but must **NOT** be in LOCALHOST).  
  - The application should access data from the server regardless of the host station running the program.  
  - The application must have more than three (3) types of data and must fetch more than five (5) entries.  
  
### BackEnd
A Node.js server needed to be created and deployed to a web service of our choice. The requirements were:  
  - The homepage must be a portfolio website that was created previously in the semester. This should be accessible from '/', 'index', or 'index/html'.  
  - The API data must be served from '/api' so that it can be accessed from the front-end application.  
  - A public folder should contain the portfolio website and JSON file.  

### MongoDB (optional)
If desired, data can be imported to MongoDB and retrieved by the server to host on the Node.js server API.
